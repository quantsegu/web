title: DBX EDM Platform
description: Building the Next-Generation Enterprise Data Management Platform

We are building a modern Enterprise Data Management (EDM) and Master Data Management (MDM) platform designed for organizations that need scale, automation, and control over complex data landscapes.

Today’s enterprises struggle with fragmented data sources, inconsistent master data, manual reconciliation, and rigid MDM tools that are expensive to customize and slow to evolve. Our goal is to change that.

This platform is designed from the ground up to be catalogue-driven, automated, and industry-aware, enabling faster onboarding of data sources, stronger data quality, and reliable delivery of trusted data to downstream systems.

features:

At its core, the platform provides:

Automated connectivity and ingestion from multiple data sources
(manual uploads, market data providers, internal systems, and external feeds)

Catalogue-based processing, where every source is managed through its own catalogue covering ingestion, processing, and validation

Industry-specific data models, allowing users to configure master data based on their domain rather than starting from scratch

A centralized Canonical Data Model (CDM) that standardizes data across domains

End-to-end orchestration from ingestion to publication, including matching, mastering, validation, and delivery

Built-in scalability, with automatic resource scaling before processing begins

Key Capabilities

Automation by Default
The platform handles data type checks, schema drift, validation, and orchestration automatically, reducing operational overhead.

Industry-Specific Modeling
Users can select industry-aligned data models, define master fields, choose authoritative sources, and apply transformations only where needed.

Catalogue-Driven Architecture
Every data source is governed through a catalogue, ensuring consistency, traceability, and repeatable processing across the organization.

Strong Data Governance
Data retention rules, read-only access, validation checks, and controlled publication are first-class capabilities.

Reliable Data Delivery
Trusted, mastered data is published to downstream systems such as accounting and reporting platforms through the canonical model.

Who This Is For

Enterprises managing complex reference, master, and market data

Data and platform teams seeking scalable alternatives to legacy MDM tools

Organizations modernizing toward cloud-native, data-platform-driven architectures

Teams that want flexibility without sacrificing governance

Our Vision

We believe enterprise data management should be:

Configurable, not custom-coded

Automated, not manually operated

Industry-aware, not generic

Scalable by design

This project is an active build, driven by real-world enterprise data challenges and modern platform principles. More details, demos, and early access opportunities will be shared soon.
